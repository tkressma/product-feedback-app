## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Component-Scoped Styles with CSS Modules
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JS runtime environment
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Node.js framework
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - NoSQL database program

### What I learned

- **React Redux is awesome** - I enjoy the seperation of actions and reducers. I feel as is Redux is very scalable for larger projects, so I may continue to use it even in my smaller projects. I know there is a lot of discussion between using Redux and using the Context API; I will eventually try out the Context API before making any comments on which is better.

- **Express and Mongoose** - Since I have prior experience with creating RESTful APIs, I had little to no issues when learning and implementing my backend using these frameworks. Mongoose made it very easy to communicate between the server and the MongoDB database. Moving forward with full stack application development, I believe it is a no brainer using these two frameworks for my back end.
